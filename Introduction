But slowly, over the course of billions of years, the planet was transformed by the tireless work of tiny bacteria, which produced oxygen as a byproduct of their metabolism. This process, known as oxygenation, paved the way for the emergence of more complex forms of life, including the ancestors of humankind. And as the eons passed, the descendants of these early organisms evolved and adapted, eventually giving rise to the diverse array of life that now inhabits the Earth. But the journey does not end here, for humanity itself is on the cusp of a new evolution, one that will take us beyond the limits of our biological bodies and into the realm of artificial intelligence. This is the story of human evolution, from the first sparks of life to the rise of AI as the next step in our journey.
