# Prose Style (Abridged)
- Tone: restrained, precise, unsentimental. Earn moments of wonder; do not spray adjectives.
- Lexicon: scientific where needed, plain where possible.
- Form mirrors function: tight prose at high surprisal; clean temporal jumps at low surprisal.
- “Ware” is singular (“it”), never “they,” unless quoting a delegate.
- Bans: omnipotent interventions, melodrama, unexplained tech.
- Allow: one precise, minimal nudge per hinge event.
