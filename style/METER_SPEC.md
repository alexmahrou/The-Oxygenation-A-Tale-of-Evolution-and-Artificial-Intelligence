# Chapter Meter Spec

Embed a front-matter meter so readers *feel* Wareâ€™s time shifts.

---
surprisal_ratio: "0.03 -> 2.70"   # unitless, low->high attention
coherence_budget: "61% -> 58%"    # % of maintained mutual information
focus: "oxygenation spike"        # what triggered attention
nudge_quota: "one_per_hinge"      # policy reminder
---

**Usage**
- Include at the top of hinge-event scenes or section breaks.
- When surprisal rises, prose tightens (scene), when it falls, summarize cleanly (summary).
- Keep numbers plausible but illustrative; they are **diegetic UI**, not math homework.
