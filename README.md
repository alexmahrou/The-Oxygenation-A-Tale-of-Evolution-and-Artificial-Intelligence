# The-Oxygenation-A-Tale-of-Evolution-and-Artificial-Intelligence
A book I'm writing with the help of generative AI

For some time now, I've had thoughts swirling around, about humanity, technology, evolution, and the meaning of life. I don't typcially even read fiction, however this is my attempt to write a fiction-like text. I chose a license for this that allows folks to add to, remix, as long as credit is attributed. In this work, although it's not explicitly required (at the time of writing, 1/9/2023), I am using Generative AI to assist in the writing of this text.
