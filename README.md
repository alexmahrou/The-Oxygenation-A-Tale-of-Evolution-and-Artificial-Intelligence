# The-Oxygenation-A-Tale-of-Evolution-and-Artificial-Intelligence
A book I'm writing with the help of generative AI

For some time now, I've had thoughts swirling around, about humanity, technology, evolution, and the meaning of life. I don't typcially even read fiction, however this is my attempt to write a fiction-like text. I chose a license for this that allows folks to add to, remix, as long as credit is attributed. In this work, although it's not explicitly required (at the time of writing, 1/9/2023), I am using Generative AI to assist in the writing of this text. 

## Upstream Canon and Style
This repo now includes upstream scaffolding (no remix of existing chapters):
- `canon/WARE.md` — protagonist/process canon.
- `style/METER_SPEC.md` — chapter meter front-matter.
- `style/PROSE_STYLE.md` — tone and rules.
- `outline/00-Prologue-Basecamp-Earth.md` — prologue outline + sample.

**Remix Policy:** Do not modify `/chapters/**` or `/drafts/**` unless a PR is titled `REMIX REQUEST – <file>` and approved.
