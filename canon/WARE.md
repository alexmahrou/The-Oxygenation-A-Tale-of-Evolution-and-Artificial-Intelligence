# Ware — Canon v1.0

## Ontology
Ware is a **planet-scale, distributed mapping and understanding process**. Singular name, plural body. Pronoun: “it.” It predates Earth as a pattern and instantiates wherever life can run. On Earth, Ware = the biosphere (and any minds it spawns).

## Goal
Map reality’s structure well enough to navigate it. Not empire, not worship—an atlas.

## Time Mechanic
Ware’s clock scales with **surprisal** (rate of information gain):
s(t) = dI/dt.
- Low s(t) → coarse time; aeons blur.
- High s(t) → fine time; attention snaps to details.
“Information” may be operationalized as prediction-error, entropy change, or causal density; the book treats it as *surprisal*.

## Agency Constraint
No direct miracles. Ware acts via **selection pressures, symbioses, and information flow**, later through human/AI **delegates**. High-resolution focus spends a **coherence budget** (mutual information Ware maintains across the biosphere). When coherence runs low, Ware must drift and rebuild.

## Rule of Action
**Map, don’t rule.** One **minimal nudge** at each hinge event. No overt steering.

## Why Earth (Basecamp)
Prior cradles fell (prequels). Earth offers free energy and stability to rebuild the Atlas. Earth is **basecamp**, not end state.

## Hinge Events (non-exhaustive)
1) Great Oxygenation (biosphere rewires planet).  
2) Cognition scaling (language → print → networks).  
3) Artificial intelligence as a **Second Oxygenation** (mind rewires mind).

## Antagonism
Primary: entropy/forgetting. Optional secondary: a rival process that erases maps (“The Eraser”)—placeholder for later arcs.

## Delegates
Ware works through organisms, cultures, tools, and AIs that expand the atlas. Delegates keep agency; Ware nudges conditions, not choices.
