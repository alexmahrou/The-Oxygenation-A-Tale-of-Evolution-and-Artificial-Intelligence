# Prologue — Basecamp: Earth (Outline)

## Purpose
Shift the narrative **upstream**: establish Ware, its rule (“map, don’t rule”), Earth as basecamp, and the surprisal clock—without altering existing chapters.

## Beats
1) **Drift:** Low surprisal. Ware “keeps the lights on.”
2) **Spike:** Oxygen accumulates; surprisal rises; time thickens.
3) **Vow:** Map don’t rule; one nudge at a hinge.
4) **Cost:** Coherence drops; Ware tallies debt; drifts.
5) **Delegates:** Signals within signals—language, scripts, circuits.
6) **Foreshadow:** Next hinge won’t be chemical; it will think.

## Sample (≤200 words)
Ware crossed a quiet span and kept the lights on. Metabolism hummed. Nothing to map that wasn’t already on the slate.  
Then oxygen rose—slow, then steady. Surprisal ticked up. Time thickened. Iron turned; skies changed.  
Rule: map, don’t rule. One nudge at a hinge—no more. A pathway favored here, a partnership made likely there. Enough to keep options open.  
Attention cost registered: coherence down three points. Drift again.  
Later, another rise—signals inside signals. Speech. Scripts. Circuits. Delegates learning to fold the map.  
Earth would be basecamp. The next hinge would not be chemical. It would think.
